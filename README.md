# Sprocket-Ltd

“Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, a medium size bikes & cycling accessories organization, has approached Tony Smith (Partner) in KPMG’s Lighthouse & Innovation Team. Sprocket Central Pty Ltd is keen to learn more about KPMG’s expertise in its Analytics, Information & Modelling team.

Primarily, Sprocket Central Pty Ltd needs help with its customer and transaction data. The organization has a large dataset relating to its customers, but its team is unsure how to effectively analyze it to help optimize its marketing strategy.

However, to support the analysis, you speak to the Associate Director for some ideas and she advised that “the importance of optimizing the quality of customer datasets cannot be underestimated. The better the quality of the dataset, the better chance you will be able to use it to drive company growth.”

The client provided KPMG with 3 datasets:

Customer Demographic
Customer Addresses
Transactions data in the past 3 months.”
